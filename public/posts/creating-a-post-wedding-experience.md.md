## You might be wondering, what a post-wedding photograph means. In brief words, it is a shoot that is taken after a wedding. Some people might think it is not necessary, considering the couple had already created memories on the wedding day. Well, it has its importance.

## No matter how dreamy your wedding venue is, there are always going to be limitations on where to take your portrait photographs. So having this session, gives you the opportunity to pick a location without putting the guests, decoration and other factors into consideration. You get to choose the right emotional place. Looking at the beautiful pictures on display, you would see the nice spot used for Samuel and Dami.

## Another significance is when there is no time factor. In the wedding, a lot of things might happen and you don’t get your dope picture. This gives you a chance to get that. Time is the gift that allows couples relax and lean in to enjoy their shoots without any distraction. It also helps them dictate their schedule which is not bound by the wedding planner.

## There is nothing as beautiful and romantic as getting that “treasured picture”. That moment when you have all the attention you need with every detail put into display. That moment when the the light is focused on you alone and your portraits are flooded with stunning golden hues, screaming “the married couple”.

## Well, thinking about it, this session comes with a lot of consideration. The cost of the photography and maybe makeup but trust me I am a huge advocate for it and it’s totally worth it.

## I won’t stress it but rather let your eyes behold the magic we made with Samuel and Dami at Crush Rock Ushafa.
